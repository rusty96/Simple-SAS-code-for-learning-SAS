The lowercase Basin values are not in the results because they are not matching values. To fix this, you can use the UPCASE function in the ON expression to change the values to uppercase. 

proc sql;
select Season, Name, s.Basin, BasinName, MaxWindMPH 
    from pg1.storm_summary as s 
        inner join pg1.storm_basincodes as b 
        on upcase(s.basin)=b.basin 
    order by Season desc, Name;
quit;
